    <h2>Coming soon</h2>

    <p>
    The complete book is launching <strong>Monday, September 26th</strong>. If you want a reminder for the launch, go to <a href="https://www.codetriage.com">https://www.codetriage.com</a> and sign up for an account. You'll also get an exclusive discount code for the book, valid for the first five (5) days of launch.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>Limited Q&A series - First five (5) days only</h2>
    <p>
        For the first five (5) days of launch, anyone who purchases the book will automatically receive free entry into a three (3) Q&A session with the author. These are recorded live and will include questions you can submit before or during the session. If you're in a different timezone, videos will be recorded and sent to those that purchase in the first five days.
    </p>

    <p>
This is truly a limited opportunity. There will be no repeat sessions, and the footage will not be released or resold. The only way to get access is to buy in the first five days. There will be no extensions or exceptions. If you miss it by one minute, you miss out.
    </p>

    <p>
Anyone who buys in the first five days will receive details on accessing the Q&A sessions once the five-day window is over.
